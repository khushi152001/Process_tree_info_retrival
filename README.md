`ProcessTreeInspector` is a C program designed to manage and query process trees in a Linux environment. It allows users to specify a root process and a target process ID, performing various operations based on the relationship between these processes within the process tree.

## Features

The program supports several operations, such as:
- Listing process IDs (PIDs) and parent process IDs (PPIDs).
- Killing, stopping, and continuing processes.
- Listing direct descendants, non-direct descendants, siblings, and grandchildren of a process.
- Checking if processes are defunct.
